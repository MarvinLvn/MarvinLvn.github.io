**[ðŸŽ‰ Funding]** Glad to share I obtained funding from the [Simons Center for the Social Brain](https://scsb.mit.edu/people/scsb-postdoctoral-fellows/marvin-lavechin-ph-d/) for a 2-year postdoc at MIT!
I'll join the [Computational Psycholinguistics lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/) starting May 1st, 2025 to work with Roger Levy and Elika Bergelson!
