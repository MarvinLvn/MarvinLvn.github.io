I am currently a Simons postdoctoral fellow in the [Computational Psycholinguistics lab](http://cpl.mit.edu/) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (Cambridge, US) under the supervision of [Roger Levy](https://www.mit.edu/~rplevy/) and [Elika Bergelson](https://bergelsonlab.com/bergelson-personal-page.html).
Formerly, at [Meta AI](https://research.facebook.com/), [LSCP](https://lscp.dec.ens.fr/en) (Paris, France), and [GIPSA](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/) (Grenoble, France).

My work is at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Cognitive Sciences**. In my interdisciplinary research program, I study language development in infants and machines. In particular, my research articulates along two major axes: 1) developing and democratizing artificial neural networks to automatically analyze childrenâ€™s language environment and linguistic production (supervised learning) and 2) running human-inspired computer simulations of language development to build more efficient algorithms and identify mechanisms driving language acquisition in infants (unsupervised/self-supervised learning).
