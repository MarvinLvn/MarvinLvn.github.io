I am a PhD student under the supervision of Alejandrina Cristia, Hervé Bredin and Emmanuel Dupoux.
I work between [Meta AI](https://research.facebook.com/) and the [Cognitive Machine Learning](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/bootphon/index.html) and [Language Acquisition Across Cultures](https://lscp.dec.ens.fr/en/research/teams-lscp/language-acquisition-across-cultures) teams of the [LSCP](https://lscp.dec.ens.fr/en).

My work is at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence** and **Cognitive Sciences**. My research focuses on **language acquisition modeling** and **speech processing** applications to the study of language development in general.

Broad research questions include: How can we build machines that learn to perceive language? How can we better compare humans and machines in language-perceptual tasks? What makes infants so efficient at learning language?
